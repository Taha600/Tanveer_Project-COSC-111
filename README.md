## Author: Syed Taha Tanveer

### Description of the project: 

This is a program which allows users to keep track of their items that they own which will be stored in an inventory.
The purpose of this program is to allow the user to add, remove, view, and search for some specific item.

### How to run my project:

When you start my program the menu will appear asking you to enter between options 1 through 7 (the program will take int as input)

1. Add new item
2. Remove item
3. Display all items
4. Search for an item
5. See statistics
6. Save Inventory
7. Exit

If you chose option one you will need to input the item name, category and quantity
The output would then display the confirmation of the changes

If you choose to remove an item then you input the the item name and if item you want to delete exists then the item will be removed other the output would be "Item not found."

If you choose to display items then the code will output all the items currently in the inventory

If you chose to search then the user will input an item name and the program will output code details or if the item isn't found the program will tell the user that the item wasn't found

If the user inputs to view the statistics then the program will output all the different items and the total quantity of those items

If the user decides to save the inventory then the code will ask him for an input of their desired file to import the data to and then the program will save the inventory in that file

Lastly if the user decides to choose the last option then the program will exit and end

Varialbes that will be updated would be the inventory contents the item count as well as the quantities of the items
